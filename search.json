    "text": "1 Background and aims\nIn order to describe the ecological condition of wetland, an inclusion of hydrology is essential. Still, there are no operational ecosystem condition indicators that adequately describe the hydrological status of wetlands in Norway.\nIn Norway, trenching in order to lower the water table of mires has been widely conducted for centuries, and systematically conducted for about 150 years, most commonly in order to facilitate the cultivation of crops or trees. Today, the creation of new trenches is not allowed, yet the scars of old and also more recently made or maintained trenches are evident in the landscape. Many of the trenched ares have changed from open wetlands into forest or agriculture.\nThere are no official maps of mire trenches in Norway. In order to make such a map, Vegar Bakkestuen did a pilot study to see if he could identify trenches from LiDAR. After annotation ground-trouthed data from several regions in Norway, he trained a deep-learning algorithm to estimate the probability of the occurrence of trenches. The model was applied to a number of smaller study areas in Norway. The results were promising, and efforts are underway to scale up this model and predict mire trenches across Norway.\nThis projects goal is to develop a concept for how this national trenching map can be used in the near future to characterize the hydrological status of mires in Norway though the use of a normative indicator. Some of the requirements for such an indicator include having area-representative data (i.e.¬†wall-to-wall data or balanced on key environmental variables), and the ability to regularly update the indicator values based on new information. It is also recommended that indicators are based on open data and source code.",

    "text": "3.1 The importance of the ecosystem accounting area\nWe presented a study area of r round(myx*myy/10^6) km2. However, for the purpose of an ecosystem condition account or assessment, this area needs to be partitioned into unique and non-overlapping ecosystems, and our indicator needs to address the ecosystem condition the target ecosystem explicitly. The ecosystem that this indicator is aimed at is wetlands, or v√•tmark in Norwegian. We therefore need to mask our spatial data at some stage in order to exclude trenches identified in other ecosystems. However, this is problematic for several reasons. First, we do not have an official ecosystem delineation map, and it is not yet clear if the ecosystem should be defined as all types of wetlands, or just open wetlands. In the case of the latter, we have a quite good ecosystem map that we can use. But in doing so, we automatically exclude wetlands, or previous wetlands, that have become forested due to the lowered water table that comes from trenching. In other words, we exclude the areas that are in the worst condition.\nThis is a well known issue in ecosystem accounting (ref Jacobson). In the following we decide to strictly follow the UN standard for ecosystem accounting and only focus on the open mires. However, in the future, if the target ecosystem becomes defined as to include forested mires, then it is not a problem to update this indicator to include such areas as well.",

    "section": "3.2 Frequency-based metrics",
    "text": "3.2 Frequency-based metrics\nThe frequency of trenches can be measured in many ways and at amny different scales. One way is to use the NiN variable called 7TK and the measurement scale A4b (ref). This approach consists of gridding the entire study region into 10ùñ∑10 m cells, and then categorizing the cells as having or not having trenches. The frequency of grid cells with trenches determines the variable value.\nThe upper and lower reference values for the variable is probably best defined using the natural value of 0% and 100%, respectively. However, the rescaling of the variable into an indicator should probably follow some non-linear function, potentially aided by a threshold value representing the value of the variable that defines the separation distinction good and bad ecosystem condition (ref). Expert opinion, possibly aided by real word data or visual aids such as areal photos of areas with different variable value, could be used to set this threshold value.\nA different option for a frequency-based metric include counting the proportion of mire units (e.g.¬†hydrological units) that are affected by trenching. This approach require that we know the population of mire units, or that we have a good, balanced sample of such units, to base our metric on. We do not have this currently. Secondly, the metric, as is it described here, becomes quite sensible to errors in the trenching model, and would probably require setting some (arbitrary) threshold value for the severity of trenching on each mire unit.",

This metric is very simple and easily interpretable. The metric is also ecologically relevant, as the length of trenches is probably among the metrices that best explain the impact of trenching on the landscape (in combination with the depth of the trenches, but this is not something we have data on currently).\nThe upper reference value must be defined as 0 m of trenches. The lower reference value is not obvious, nor the threshold value. These cold be defined using expert opinion, as described for Section 3.2.",
