# Possible metrics {#sec-metrics}

From the map of trenches (@fig-map1) we want to extract some numerical value 
that we can assign to an area in order to describe the severity of trenching.
This metric, or variable, need to be

- simple
- interpretable
- updatable
- area explicit

It can be based on for example on some variation using the the length or 
frequency of trenches. 
The area of trenches is less suitable, as trenches are in reality linear 
elements even though we represent them here as polygons. 
The polygons could be turned into line elements, for example by finding 
the central lines using ET Geowizards. 
However, this is computationally heavy, and we think that the length of the 
trenches can be reasonably approximated using half the circumference, 
minus a small penalty. 
The density of trenches is also less suitable as the individual polygons are
somewhat arbitrarily separated.

## The importance of the ecosystem accounting area
We presented a study area of `r round(myx*myy/10^6)` km^2^. 
However, for the purpose of an ecosystem condition account or assessment, 
this area needs to be partitioned into unique and non-overlapping ecosystems,
and our indicator needs to address the ecosystem condition the target ecosystem explicitly.
The ecosystem that this indicator is aimed at is wetlands, or _v√•tmark_ in Norwegian.
We therefore need to mask our spatial data at some stage in order to exclude 
trenches identified in other ecosystems. 
However, this is problematic for several reasons.
First, we do not have an official ecosystem delineation map,
and it is not yet clear if the ecosystem should be defined as all types of wetlands,
or just open wetlands. 
In the case of the latter, we have a quite good ecosystem map that we can use. 
But in doing so, we automatically exclude wetlands, or previous wetlands, that 
have become forested due to the lowered water table that comes from trenching.
In other words, we exclude the areas that are in the worst condition.

This is a well known issue in ecosystem accounting (ref Jacobson).
In the following we decide to strictly follow the UN standard for ecosystem accounting
and only focus on the open mires.
However, in the future, if the target ecosystem becomes defined as to include 
forested mires, then it is not a problem to update this indicator to include such 
areas as well.

## Frequency-based metrics {#sec-fbm}
The frequency of trenches can be measured in many ways and at amny different scales.
One way is to use the NiN variable called `7TK` and the measurement scale `A4b` (ref).
This approach consists of gridding the entire study region into 10ùñ∑10 m cells,
and then categorizing the cells as having or not having trenches. 
The frequency of grid cells with trenches determines the variable value.

The upper and lower reference values for the variable is probably best defined 
using the natural value of 0% and 100%, respectively. 
However, the rescaling of the variable into an indicator should probably follow
some non-linear function, potentially aided by a threshold value representing the
value of the variable that defines the separation distinction good and bad ecosystem 
condition (ref).
Expert opinion, possibly aided by real word data or visual aids such as areal 
photos of areas with different variable value, could be used to set this threshold value.

A different option for a frequency-based metric include counting the proportion of mire 
units (e.g. hydrological units) that are affected by trenching. 
This approach require that we know the population of mire units, or that
we have a good, balanced sample of such units, to base our metric on.
We do not have this currently. 
Secondly, the metric, as is it described here, becomes quite sensible to errors
in the trenching model, and would probably require setting some (arbitrary) threshold
value for the _severity_ of trenching on each mire unit.

## Length based metrics
As describes earlier, the length of trenches, and therefore also the accumulated 
length for any given area, may be approximated by using half the circumference 
of the trenching polygons (minus some small penalty).
This metric is very simple and easily interpretable. 
The metric is also ecologically relevant, as the length of trenches is 
probably among the metrices that best explain the impact of trenching on the 
landscape (in combination with the depth of the trenches, but this is not 
something we have data on currently).

The upper reference value must be defined as 0 m of trenches.
The lower reference value is not obvious, nor the threshold value. 
These cold be defined using expert opinion, as described for @sec-fbm.
