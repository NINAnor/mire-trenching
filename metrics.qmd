# Possible metrics {#sec-metrics}

From the map of trenches (@fig-map1) we want to extract some numerical value 
that we can assign to an area in order to describe the severity of trenching.
This metric, or variable, need to be

- simple
- interpretable
- updatable
- area explicit
- scalable (optional)

It can be based on for example on some variation using the the length or 
frequency of trenches. 
The area of trenches is less suitable, as trenches are in reality linear 
elements even though we represent them here as polygons. 
The polygons could be turned into line elements, for example by finding 
the central lines using ET Geowizards. 
However, this is computationally heavy, and we think that the length of the 
trenches can be reasonably approximated using half the circumference, 
minus a small penalty. 
The density of trenches is also less suitable as the individual polygons are
somewhat arbitrarily separated.


## Frequency-based metrics {#sec-fbm}
The frequency of trenches can be measured in many ways and at amny different scales.
One way is to use the NiN variable called `7TK` and the measurement scale `A4b` (ref).
This approach consists of gridding the entire study region into 10ùñ∑10 m cells,
and then categorizing the cells as having or not having trenches. 
The frequency of grid cells with trenches determines the variable value.

The upper and lower reference values for the variable is probably best defined 
using the natural value of 0% and 100%, respectively. 
However, the rescaling of the variable into an indicator should probably follow
some non-linear function, potentially aided by a threshold value representing the
value of the variable that defines the separation distinction good and bad ecosystem 
condition (ref).
Expert opinion, possibly aided by real word data or visual aids such as areal 
photos of areas with different variable value, could be used to set this threshold value.

A different option for a frequency-based metric include counting the proportion of mire 
units (e.g. hydrological units) that are affected by trenching. 
This approach require that we know the population of mire units, or that
we have a good, balanced sample of such units, to base our metric on.
We do not have this currently. 
Secondly, the metric, as is it described here, becomes quite sensible to errors
in the trenching model, and would probably require setting some (arbitrary) threshold
value for the _severity_ of trenching on each mire unit.

## Length based metrics
As describes earlier, the length of trenches, and therefore also the accumulated 
length for any given area, may be approximated by using half the circumference 
of the trenching polygons (minus some small penalty).
This metric is very simple and easily interpretable. 
The metric is also ecologically relevant, as the length of trenches is 
probably among the metrices that best explain the impact of trenching on the 
landscape (in combination with the depth of the trenches, but this is not 
something we have data on currently).

The upper reference value must be defined as 0 m of trenches.
The lower reference value is not obvious, nor the threshold value. 
These cold be defined using expert opinion, as described for @sec-fbm.

### Area-based metric
The area affected by trenching can perhaps be estimated by adding a buffer on
the trenching polygons. The area affected by trenching as a proportion of the 
total mire area is a nice and simple concept for an indicator.
The challenge is how to define the buffer. 
10 m buffers have been used in the past. 
However, the size of the effect from a trench decreases non-linearly from the 
center of the ditch, 
and the length of the effect zone will depend a lot on the local typography. 
Ditches at the bottom of sloping mires will be more effective at draining
water from the mire than a trench located near the top.
Perhaps information about sloe could be included in the calculation of buffer widths?


## Scalability
The metric chosen to inform the indicator on trenching should idealy be scalable,
meaning it can be calculated or interpreted at different scale.
The indicator might be useful for regional assessment of wetland condition,
as well as in local or project scale assessment, for example in association with
environmental impact assessments for new building projects.

I believe the three methods describe above all all scalable and could be used 
at local scales as well as regional scale (which is the main focus here).
