## The importance of the ecosystem accounting area
We presented a study area of `r round(myx*myy/10^6)` km^2^. 
However, for the purpose of an ecosystem condition account or assessment, 
this area needs to be partitioned into unique and non-overlapping ecosystems,
and our indicator needs to address the ecosystem condition the target ecosystem explicitly.
The ecosystem that this indicator is aimed at is wetlands, or _v√•tmark_ in Norwegian.
We therefore need to mask our spatial data at some stage in order to exclude 
trenches identified in other ecosystems. 
However, this is problematic for several reasons.
First, we do not have an official ecosystem delineation map,
and it is not yet clear if the ecosystem should be defined as all types of wetlands,
or just open wetlands. 
In the case of the latter, we have a quite good ecosystem map that we can use. 
But in doing so, we automatically exclude wetlands, or previous wetlands, that 
have become forested due to the lowered water table that comes from trenching.
In other words, we exclude the areas that are in the worst condition.

This is a well known issue in ecosystem accounting (ref Jacobson).
In the following we decide to strictly follow the UN standard for ecosystem accounting
and only focus on the open mires.
However, in the future, if the target ecosystem becomes defined as to include 
forested mires, then it is not a problem to update this indicator to include such 
areas as well.
